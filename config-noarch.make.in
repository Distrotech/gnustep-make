#   config-noarch.make.in
#
#   The settings required by the makefile package that are determined
#   by configure but that are independent of the platform that we
#   are working on (keep in mind we can support multiple platforms
#   being used at the same time!).
#
#   In practice, this file should containg global gnustep-make options
#   (like GNUSTEP_IS_FLATTENED or GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT), as opposed to
#   config info needed to build or compile or do things on a certain
#   platform (like CC or OPTFLAG), which should go into config.make
