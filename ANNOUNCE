Announcement
************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 1.8.0 is now available.

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

   The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to
write makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to
write a project without having to deal with the complex issues
associated with configuration, building, installation, and packaging.
It also allows the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

   Note that versions that have a odd minor release number (the second
number, y, in x.y.z) are unstable releases (like 1.5.2), while even
minor release numbers (1.4.1) are stable releases.

Changes in version `1.8.0'
==========================

   Read the NEWS file for a complete list of changes since the last
stable release. The major difference from 1.6.0 is that the locations
of certain directories have changed. Generally this will not cause a
problem unless your GNUstep directory is shared by multiple machines
running this and earlier (1.6.x) versions of the software.

Obtaining gnustep-make
======================

   You can get the gstep-make-1.8.0.tar.gz distribution file at
