Announcement
************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 1.10.0 is now available.

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

Changes in version `1.10.0'
===========================

   * a GNUsteprc file is now automatically created and installed in
     $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT, which sets the system-wide default for the
     user root directory (default=~/GNUstep, which can be overriden
     with the `--with-user-root' argument to configure, or by modifying
     GNUsteprc after configuration.)

   * make_services is not run by GNUstep.sh anymore. You must run this
     manually now (see the gnustep-gui documentation).

   * Palettes use a plist instead of a strings format file now for the
     palette.table file.

   * You can use the `--enable-native-objc-exceptions' argument to
     configure to enable use of built in objc exceptions with compilers
     that support it.
