The currently released version is `1.2.0'.

Changes in version `1.2.0'
==========================

   * The core rules and internals of gnustep-make have been
     fundamentally redesigned and rewritten.  notably, gnustep-make now
     works using only a single recursive sub-make invocation rather
     than two, which makes it consistently faster and simpler in all
     circumstances.

   * The clean rules have been heavily optimized - they no longer use
     recursive sub-make invocations at all and so they are really fast.

   * Many improvements to java support. Optimized management of nested
     classes

   * Better conformance to make conventions.

   * File specific compilation flags

   * Fixed darwin support

   * Support for C++ files.

   * Made use of library installation dir consistent with other
     installation.

   * Much improved Windows path support

Changes in version `1.0.1'
==========================

   * Support for Java tools.

   * Build GUI backend as a bundle (default).

   * Remove backend part of LIBRARY_COMBO.

   * Fixes to run on FreeBSD, Solaris.

Changes in version `1.0.0'
==========================

   * Optimizations that in many cases more than double the speed.

   * Added preliminary darwin support.

   * rpm packeing improvements.

   * Better checking for mingw and cygwin

Changes in version `0.9.2'
==========================

   * HOWTO and faq files moved from core package to here

   * Configurable GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT and GNUSTEP_NETWORK_ROOT

Changes in version `0.9.1'
==========================

   Make has been reoganized so that it only relies on libraries and
other things that are necessary for the Makefile package itself. Any
libraries wanting to add extra package information can do so by
installing a make stub in the `Additional' directory. This greatly
simplifies compilation and packaging.

   * Javadoc support added.

   * debian directory added for dpkg

   * RPM support rewritten from scratch.

Changes in version `0.9.0'
==========================

   ffcall library is highly recommended for use with the GNUstep base
library. You need to have installed it prior to configuring the Makefile
package. See the INSTALL file.

   * Support for automatically generating RPM spec files.

   * Build suitable files for MacOS bundles

   * Add option for flattened directory structure.

   * LaText documentation support.

   * Added support for Frameworks

Noteworthy changes in version `0.6.6'
=====================================

   The GNUstep system libraries are now installed in a separate system
root directory (default /usr/GNUstep/System) rather than the GNUstep
root directory (default /usr/GNUstep). You can revert to the old
behavior using a configure option `--without-system-root'. We also
recommend removing any previous GNUstep versions before installing the
new one in order to avoid problems with the system finding the correct
binary and/or library.

   * Support for Windows compilation (cygwin and mingw) and DLL creation
     and usage.

   * Java support rewritten and extended.
