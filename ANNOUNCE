The GNUstep Makefile Package version 1.2.0 is now available.

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

   The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to
write makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to
write a project without having to deal with the complex issues
associated with configuration, building, installation, and packaging.
It also allows the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

Changes in version `1.2.0'
==========================

   * The core rules and internals of gnustep-make have been
     fundamentally redesigned and rewritten.  notably, gnustep-make now
     works using only a single recursive sub-make invocation rather
     than two, which makes it consistently faster and simpler in all
     circumstances.

   * The clean rules have been heavily optimized - they no longer use
     recursive sub-make invocations at all and so they are really fast.

   * Many improvements to java support. Optimized management of nested
     classes

   * Better conformance to make conventions.

   * File specific compilation flags

   * Fixed darwin support

   * Support for C++ files.

   * Made use of library installation dir consistent with other
     installation.

   * Much improved Windows path support
