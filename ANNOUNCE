Announcement
************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 1.7.0 is now available.

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

   The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to
write makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to
write a project without having to deal with the complex issues
associated with configuration, building, installation, and packaging.
It also allows the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

   Note that versions that have a odd minor release number (the second
number, y, in x.y.z) are unstable releases (like 1.5.2), which even
minor release numbers (1.4.1) are stable releases.

Changes in version `1.7.0'
==========================

   This version contains a major change in the location of certain
directories and installed files as detailed in the `filesystem.texi'
document. When installing this version for the first time, all old
directories and files in those directories will be moved to the new
locations automatically. However, you should update all GNUstep versions
on any machine you have them installed on in order to avoid any
incompatibilities.

   Other changes:

   * Support for preprocessed Info.plists.
