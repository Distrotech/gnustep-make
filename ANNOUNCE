Announcement
************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 1.5.2 is now available.

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

   The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to
write makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to
write a project without having to deal with the complex issues
associated with configuration, building, installation, and packaging.
It also allows the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

   Note that versions that have a odd minor release number are unstable
releases (like 1.5.2), which even release numbers (1.4.1) are stable
releases.

Changes in version `1.5.2'
==========================

   Make now configures by default for only one system. To compile and
run GNUstep for multiple platforms from the same directory, use the
configure argument -enable-multi-platform.

   * Auto-build def file for DLLs

   * Work natively on MacOSX systems. Now use apple-apple-apple instead
     of nx-nx-nx on OSX systems.

   * More efficient checks for re-making a project.
