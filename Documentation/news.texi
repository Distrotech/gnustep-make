@section Changes in version @samp{1.2.0pre1}

@itemize @bullet
@item The core rules and internals of gnustep-make have been fundamentally
redesigned and rewritten.  notably, gnustep-make now works using only
a single recursive sub-make invocation rather than two, which makes
it consistently faster and simpler in all circumstances.
@item The clean rules have been heavily optimized - they no longer use 
recursive sub-make invocations at all and so they are really fast.
@item Many improvements to java support. Optimized management of nested classes
@item Better conformance to make conventions.
@item Fixed darwin support
@item Support for C++ files.
@item Made use of library installation dir consistent with other installation.
@item Much improved Windows path support

@section Changes in version @samp{0.9.1}

Make has been reoganized so that it only relies on libraries and other things
that are necessary for the Makefile package itself. Any libraries wanting to
add extra package information can do so by installing a make stub in the
@file{Additional} directory. This greatly simplifies compilation and packaging.

@itemize @bullet
@item Javadoc support added.
@item debian directory added for dpkg
@item RPM support rewritten from scratch.
@end itemize

@section Changes in version @samp{0.9.0}

ffcall library is highly recommended for use with the GNUstep base
library. You need to have installed it prior to configuring the Makefile
package. See the INSTALL file.

@itemize @bullet
@item Support for automatically generating RPM spec files.
@item Build suitable files for MacOS bundles
@item Add option for flattened directory structure.
@item LaText documentation support.
@item Added support for Frameworks
@end itemize

@section Noteworthy changes in version @samp{0.6.6}

The GNUstep system libraries are now installed in a separate system root
directory (default /usr/GNUstep/System) rather than the GNUstep
root directory (default /usr/GNUstep). You can revert to the old behavior
using a configure option @samp{--without-system-root}. We also recommend
removing any previous GNUstep versions before installing the new one in order
to avoid problems with the system finding the correct binary and/or library.

@itemize @bullet
@item Support for Windows compilation (cygwin and mingw) and DLL creation
and usage.
@item Java support rewritten and extended.
