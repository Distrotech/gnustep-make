@chapter GNUstep makefile package

Here is some introductory info to get you started:

@section What is the GNUstep makefile package?

The makefile package is a simplistic, powerful and extensible way to
write makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to
write a GNUstep-based project without having to deal with the complex
issues associated with the configuration and installation of the core
GNUstep libraries.  It also allows the user to easily create
cross-compiled binaries.

@section Information

The file @samp{NEWS} has the library's feature history.

The files @samp{INSTALL} or @samp{GNUstep-HOWTO} (from the core package)
gives instructions for installing the library.

Files in the @samp{Documentation} directory have information on the
design of the Makefile system and how to write your own makefiles that
work with it.

@section History

The GNUstep makefile package was designed by Scott Christley
@email{scottc@@net-community.com} and Ovidiu Predescu
@email{ovidiu@@net-community.com}.

Flags for building shared libraries and bundles on several systems were
originally identified by Mircea Oancea @email{mircea@@pathcom.com}.

Richard Frith-Macdonald @email{richard@@brainstorm.co.uk} also
contributed with ideas.
