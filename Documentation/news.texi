@section Changes in version @samp{0.9.1}

Make has been reoganized so that it only relies on libraries and other things
that are necessary for the Makefile package itself. Any libraries wanting to
add extra package information can do so by installing a make stub in the
@file{Additional} directory. This greatly simplifies compilation and packaging.

@itemize @bullet
@item Javadoc support added.
@item debian directory added for dpkg
@item RPM support rewritten from scratch.

@section Noteworthy changes in version @samp{0.6.6}

The GNUstep system libraries are now installed in a separate system root
directory (default /usr/GNUstep/System) rather than the GNUstep
root directory (default /usr/GNUstep). You can revert to the old behavior
using a configure option @samp{--without-system-root}. We also recommend
removing any previous GNUstep versions before installing the new one in order
to avoid problems with the system finding the correct binary and/or library.

@itemize @bullet
@item Support for Windows compilation (cygwin and mingw) and DLL creation
and usage.
@item Java support rewritten and extended.
