The currently released version is `0.6.7'.

Changes in version `0.9.0'
==========================

   ffcall library is highly recommended for use with the GNUstep base
library. You need to have installed it prior to configuring the Makefile
package. See the INSTALL file.

   * Support for automatically generating RPM spec files.

   * Build suitable files for MacOS bundles

   * Add option for flattened directory structure.

   * LaText documentation support.

   * Added support for Frameworks

Noteworthy changes in version `0.6.6'
=====================================

   The GNUstep system libraries are now installed in a separate system
root directory (default /usr/GNUstep/System) rather than the GNUstep
root directory (default /usr/GNUstep). You can revert to the old
behavior using a configure option `--without-system-root'. We also
recommend removing any previous GNUstep versions before installing the
new one in order to avoid problems with the system finding the correct
binary and/or library.

   * Support for Windows compilation (cygwin and mingw) and DLL creation
     and usage.

   * Java support rewritten and extended.
