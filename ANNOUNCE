Announcement
************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 1.3.0 is now available.

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

   The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to
write makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to
write a project without having to deal with the complex issues
associated with configuration, building, installation, and packaging.
It also allows the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

Changes in version `1.3.0'
==========================

   The package has gone through an extensive reorganization to break up
each sub-make into two separate components. This allows for much
simplified code and lots of code sharing between components. As a side
effect, it also increased the speed of the code by at least a factor of
2.

   * Force shared=yes for cygwin and mingw

   * Bundles copy resources from subprojects.

   * Better resource management. Resources handled accross all project
     types.

   * Simplified and fixed user root location between make and base
     libraries.

   * Changed Apps directory to Applications

   * Fixes for MacOSX, MingW
