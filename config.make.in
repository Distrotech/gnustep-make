# NB: These variables are defined here only so that they can be

# use a different awk for that particular run of make).  We should
# *NOT* set them to the full path of these tools at configure time,
# because otherwise when you change/update the tools you would need to
# reconfigure and reinstall gnustep-make!  We can normally assume that
# typing 'awk' and 'sed' on the command line cause the preferred awk
# and sed programs on the system to be used.  Hardcoding the full path
# (or the name) of the specific awk or sed program on this sytem here
