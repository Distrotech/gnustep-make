Announcement
************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 1.11.1 is now available.

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

Changes in version `1.11.1'
===========================

Part of the previous change was reversed. Now libobjc is still linked
with individual applications (as well as the base library), since some
operating systems require this to resolve external symbols. However,
there is no need to recompile all applications again.

   Compilation of GNUstep on cygwin was revampled and fixed due to a
lot of work by Tom MacSween.

Obtaining gnustep-make
