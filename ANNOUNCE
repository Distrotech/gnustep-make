**************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 2.0.5 is now available.

1.1 What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=========================================

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

1.2 Changes in version `2.0.5'
==============================

   * Update C++ and ObjC++ support so that g++ and proper flags are
     automatically used.

   * Added a new filesystem layout for Apple Mac OS X and use this by
     default on this system.

   * NEEDS_GUI variable added to determine linking behavior against gui
     library.

   * New option -enable-strict-v2-mode to test for obsolete variables.

   * ~/GNUstep/GNUstep.sh is no longer sourced.

1.3 Obtaining gnustep-make
