       GNUstep - A free implementation of the OpenStep standard


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       GNUstep  provides  an Object-Oriented application develop-
       ment framework and tool set for use on a wide  variety  of
       computer  platforms.   GNUstep  is  based  on the original
       OpenStep specification provided by NeXT, Inc. (now Apple).

       GNUstep  is  written  in  Objective-C,  a  object-oriented
       superset  of  the  C  programming  language,  similar   to
       SmallTalk.  However  there  exist  a number of brigdes and
       interfaces to develop GNUstep programs  using  other  lan-
       guages like JAVA or Ruby.

       The GNUstep core system consists of the following parts:

       gnustep-make
                   A  set  of  scripts and makefiles that heavily
              ease the      creation and maintenance of  software
              projects.

       gnustep-base
                   The  FoundationKit libraries for non-GUI tools
              providing       everything  from  string        and
              array  classes,  filemanager classes to distributed
              objects.

       gnustep-gui
                   The  AppKit  containing   widgets,   workspace
              classes and means for      applications to interact
              with  the   user.   This   is   the   frontend   of
                   GNUstep's GUI part.

       gnustep-back
                   This  is  the  backend  of  GNUstep's GUI part
              which does the actual      rendering and event han-
              dling.  It acts as a layer between      gnustep-gui
              and the operating/drawing  system.  Backends  exist
                   for  X11  (one  using  libart,  one using xlib
              drawing) and win32.

              Apart from the above, there exist a number of addon
              libraries, like Renaissance which allows developers
              to specify an application's user interface in  xml.
              For  database  access,  there is gdl2 - the GNUstep
              Database Library.  Please refer to the GNUstep web-
              site for more information.


              GNUstep  is  self-containing.  That  means that all
              GNUstep applications, tools, libraries and  add-ons
              are installed into the GNUstep directory hierarchy.
              There are  four  domains  which  are  searched  for
              files: the System domain, which should only contain
              the core  system  files,  the  Local  domain  which
              stores  all  that  has  later been installed on the
              system, the Network domain which should be used for
              importing  data  from a remote system, and the User
              domain which resides in the user's  home  directory
              (mostly  ~/GNUstep).  See the filesystem.texi docu-
              ment for more information.

       In the world of GNUstep the term _t_o_o_l  refers  to  command
       line  programs  whereas _A_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s are fully fledged GUI
       programs.  Naturally, _t_o_o_l_s reside in the  domains'  Tools
       folder, _A_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s can be found in the domains' Applica-
       tions folder.

       Applications are either launched using the openapp command
       or from the Workspace.



       SSeerrvviicceess

       In  GNUstep,  applications globally offer functionality to
       other  applications  through  _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s  applications  main
       menu.   Apart from _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s offered by applications, there
       may be programs whose sole purpose is the offering of ser-
       vices.  They  can be found in the domains' Libary/Services
       folders.


       TThhee WWoorrkkssppaaccee

       The central place of the user interface is  the  _W_o_r_k_s_p_a_c_e
       or  _W_o_r_k_s_p_a_c_e  _M_a_n_a_g_e_r  which acts as an interface between
       the user and parts of the system  like  files,  processes,
       etc.  The GWorkspace application provides this functional-
       ity in  GNUstep.  See  the  GWorkspace  website  for  more
       details.

       Most discussion and support is taking place on the GNUstep
       mailinglists     <http://www.gnustep.org/information/geth-
       elp.html>.  Additionally,  most larger projects have their
       own mailing lists. Consult the  appropriate  websites  for
       details.

       Alternatively  you  are  invited  to join the #GNUstep IRC
       channel on FreeNode (irc.freenode.net).
