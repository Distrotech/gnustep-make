GNUstep makefile package
************************

Here is some introductory info to get you started:

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

   The makefile package is a simplistic, powerful and extensible way to
write makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to
write a GNUstep-based project without having to deal with the complex
issues associated with the configuration and installation of the core
GNUstep libraries.  It also allows the user to easily create
cross-compiled binaries.

Information
===========

   The file `NEWS' has the library's feature history.

   The files `INSTALL' or `GNUstep-HOWTO' (from the core package) gives
instructions for installing the library.

   The file `DESIGN' has information on the design of the Makefile
system and how to write your own makefiles that work with it.

History
=======

   The GNUstep makefile package was designed by Scott Christley
<scottc@net-community.com> and Ovidiu Predescu
<ovidiu@net-community.com>.

   Flags for building shared libraries and bundles on several systems
were originally identified by Mircea Oancea <mircea@pathcom.com>.

   Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk> also contributed
with ideas.
