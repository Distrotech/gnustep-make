1 GNUstep Make Release Notes
****************************

The release notes include descriptions of API changes, behavior changes
and other information that might help developers and users migrate to
using a newer version of the make system.

1.1 Version 2.0.0
=================

Version 2.0.0 is a new major release of gnustep-make which includes a
number of major changes compared to previous 1.x releases.  Most of the
changes are backwards compatible in the sense that old GNUmakefiles
will work with gnustep-make version 1 or 2 when used in the same
conditions (traditional GNUstep filesystem layout).  But GNUmakefiles
might need updating to work with the new filesystem layout
configurations that are allowed by gnustep-make version 2.

`GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR'
     This variable is deprecated in gnustep-make version 2; you should
     never use it.  gnustep-make version 2 supports installation domains
     that are mapped to filesystem locations in arbitrary ways; for this
     reason, specifying a GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR no longer makes
     sense.  If you need to relocate the whole installation (for
     example, installing into /tmp to prepare a binary package) you
     should use DESTDIR, as in 'make install DESTDIR=/tmp'.  To choose
     an installation domain, you should use
     GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN, as in 'make install
     GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN=LOCAL'.  It's particularly important
     that you remove any reference to GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR inside
     your own GNUmakefiles.

     If your GNUmakefiles contains references to
     GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR (or similar), you should remove them by
     replacing them with references to the actual logical directory
     into which you want to install.  For example, if your GNUmakefile
     is trying to install something into
     GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR/Library/Libraries, you need to replace it
     with GNUSTEP_LIBRARIES.  This is important for non-GNUstep
     filesystem layouts (where, eg, GNUSTEP_LIBRARIES should be set to
     /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib or
     /home/nicola/GNUstep/Library/Libraries depending on the
     installation domain); in that case, gnustep-make will manage
     GNUSTEP_LIBRARIES for you.  Please check the file `filesystem' for
     more information on the available variables.

`GNUSTEP_xxx_ROOT'
     The variables GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT, GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT,
     GNUSTEP_NETWORK_ROOT, GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT and GNUSTEP_ROOT are
     deprecated in gnustep-make version 2 and you should never use them.
     gnustep-make version 2 supports installation domains that are
     mapped to filesystem locations in arbitrary ways; for this reason,
     a variable like GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT has no longer any use.

     If your GNUmakefiles contains references to GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT (or
     similar), you should remove them by replacing them with references
     to the actual logical directory into which you want to install.
     For example, if your GNUmakefile is trying to install something
     into GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Library/Libraries, you need to replace it
     with GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES.  Please check the file `filesystem'
     for more information on the available variables.

`gnustep-make ./configure and install options'
     The options to configure (and make install), particularly the ones
     to determine the filesystem layout, have been radically changed in
     gnustep-make version 2.  If you have a building or packaging script
     for gnustep-make, you need to make sure you replace your old
     ./configure options with the new ones.  In particular, the
     -with-system-root, -with-local-root and -with-network-root
     configure options have been replaced by the more powerful
     -with-layout configure option.  Also, configure no longer imports
     an existing configuration file so you need to make sure that you
     pass all the options every time.  'make install
     special_prefix=xxx' has been replaced by 'make install
     DESTDIR=xxx'.

`make debug=yes is now the default'
     The default used to be 'make debug=no'; this has now been changed
     to be 'make debug=yes'.  To get the traditional behaviour, please
     use 'make debug=no'.

`RPM support rewritten'
     The RPM support has been rewritten so if you're using gnustep-make
     to automatically generate RPM packages for your software, you may
     want to review the process.  In particular, there is no longer a
     distinction between debug and non-debug packages.

`xxx_PREPROCESS_INFO_PLIST'
     This variable is now obsolete and can be removed; gnustep-make
     version 2 can automatically detect plists that need preprocessing.

`Framework default version'
     The default framework resource version changed from 'A' to
     INTERFACE_VERSION (which is set, by default, to '0.0').

`Microsoft Windows updates'
     If you are using Microsoft Windows, you probably want to check the
     new installation instructions and reinstall everything.

`Java tools location changed'
     Java tools are now installed into GNUSTEP_JAVA rather than in a
     subdirectory of GNUSTEP_TOOLS.

`resource-set.make install directory'
     The variable xxx_RESOURCE_FILES_INSTALL_DIR for resource-set.make
     has been deprecated in favour of xxx_INSTALL_DIR.  For backwards
     compatibility, you may want to set them both:

     xxx_INSTALL_DIR = $(GNUSTEP_LIBRARY)/Libraries/Resources/xxx

     xxx_RESOURCE_FILES_INSTALL_DIR = /Library/Libraries/Resources/xxx

`INSTALL_ROOT_DIR'
     All instances of INSTALL_ROOT_DIR in user's makefiles should be
     replaced with DESTDIR.

`GNUSTEP_FLATTENED'
     All checks for GNUSTEP_FLATTENED should be updated to check the new
     variable GNUSTEP_IS_FLATTENED instead, and to compare it
     explicitly to 'yes' and 'no', and assume that " means 'yes'.

`./shared_obj'
     The ./shared_obj, ./shared_debug_obj directories and similar are
     no longer created.  You can use ./obj instead.

`library names'
     All libraries now have the same name.

`application names'
     All applications now have the same name.
