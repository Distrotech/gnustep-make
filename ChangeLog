	and libFoundation to get the files specific for cpu/os/runtime.
	* core.make: Allow the user to specify a set of variables different
	than the library combo. This is needed when compiling basic libraries
	that don't use the whole library combo (like libFoundation). Also
	define OBJC_RUNTIME that holds the name of the runtime, useful in make,
	and RUNTIME_DEFINE that defines for the runtime, useful while
	compiling. The last one should be added to the additional C/ObjC flags.
	* library.make: Define HEADER_FILES_DIR to be . by default.

Thu Sep 25 18:22:43 1997  Ovidiu Predescu <ovidiu@net-community.com>

	* DESIGN: A word about building different types of a project.

Thu Sep 25 17:32:37 1997  Ovidiu Predescu <ovidiu@net-community.com>

	* DESIGN: Updated to contain the latest changes in the package.
	* Makefile.in: Use a for loop to install the files.
	* aggregate.make: Commpress all the internal-* targets into a single
	rule to make the maintanance easier.

	* rules.make: Add rule for creating the object files directory here
	instead of having the same rule in several files.
	* application.make: Remove creation of the object files directory. Just
	add the dependency to the targets.
	* tool.make: Likewise.

	* clean.make: Optimize cannonicalization of host/target cpu/os/vendor
	by adding a flag that says if they are already cannoical or not.
	* target.make: Use the variable defined above to speed up the building
	process.

	* common.make: Added support for building separate versions of
	libraries for debugging, profiling and/or static or shared. Use
	different object file directories instead of using a suffix to the
	file name. Building a shared library is now the default for systems
	that support shared libraries.
	* library.make: Removed the two variables for specifying the shared
	library and the static one. Added two new target variables which
	define commands to be run after the installation of either the static
	or of the shared library.
	* target.make: Define the two new variables above for the different
	supported systems.

	* common.make: Added a partial support for the NeXT compiler. We also
	need a way to determine what compiler is used, which is simple because
	our tools only partially work with the NeXT runtime/compiler.
	* core.make: Support for the NeXT Foundation and AppKit added.
	* rules.make: Use flags to specify the include paths while compiling to
	support NeXT frameworks. Cleanup in the shared libraries support.

	* rules.make: .PRECIOUS target added to disable removing of
	intermediate files (Scott's idea).

Thu Sep 25 11:25:36 1997  Ovidiu Predescu <ovidiu@net-community.com>

	* config.site: For autoconf packages in the GNUstep directory
	structure, the headers and libraries must go into the appropriate
	target subdirectory.

	* application.make: Utilize object directory.
	* tool.make (object_dir): Rename to object-dir.
