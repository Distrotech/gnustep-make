	Better support for building applications.
	* application.make: Reworked to eliminate the need of timestamp files
	which cause weird behavior when building. Also it is possible to have
	different extensions for the application directory based upon the
	debug and profile variables (.app, .debug and .profile).
	* rules.make: Changed the name of the implicit rule %.app to
	%.buildapp to make possible creation of applications with

	application directory; this file contains additional directories that
	should be added to the dynamic libraries search paths.
	* ld_lib_path.sh: Support adding additional library paths from an
	environment variable. This is set by openapp from a file inside the
	application.
	* application.make: Output an additional file in the application
	directory containing additional library search paths.
	* common.make: New variable TRANSFORM_PATHS.

	* library.make: First install the library and then the headers.
	* rules.make: Change the order of GUI and Foundation LDFLAGS.
	* openapp.in: Remove the slashed from the end of the application name.
	* DESIGN: Fixed typos. Document how the application's directory
	extension is chosen.

	More support for building a native OPENSTEP 4.x application added.
	* core.make: Write the correct linking flags for building an
	application under OPENSTEP 4.x. Create the .iconheader file
	automatically.
	* openapp.in: Check to see if the application really exists before
	checking for the binary. Correctly check for the binary under OS 4.x.
	* target.make: On OS 4.x systems with NeXT's Foundation, use the
	native compiler. If we don't use the native compiler don't pass
	the GNU ObjC runtime library and libgcc to libtool.
	* which_lib.c: Correctly skip the libraries with the same suffix.

Tue Oct 14 11:26:15 1997  Ovidiu Predescu <ovidiu@net-community.com>

	and RUNTIME_DEFINE make variables. Correctly handle the suffix of a
	library name (using LIBRARY_NAME_SUFFIX).
	* library.make: Append to the name of the library the suffix which
	identifies its type. Output the library in the object files directory.
	* rules.make: Move INTERNAL_LDFLAGS to the end of ALL_LDFLAGS
	definition. Removed unnecessary passing of TARGET_LIB_DIR to shell
	scripts. Process the libraries used to create a test using the
	which_lib program. New variable SCRIPTS_DIRECTORY which identifies the
	location of the dejagnu scripts (it can be not defined in which case
	the current directory is assumed).
	* target.make: For OS 4.x: don't hard code the location to libobjc and
	libgcc, pass -L flags to libtool that point to the various GNUstep
	directories. Define ADDITIONAL_LDFLAGS with a flag to linker that
	disables warning for common symbols.
	* test.make: Assume the driver program is located under the object
	files directory.
	Create the unix.exp file in the config directory where the test
	scripts are located.
	Compressed the internal-check-* targets into a single target.
	* rules.make: Work with the new internal-check-* targets.
	* which_lib.c: Fixed a bug when two libraries that have the same
	prefix were matching.

	and libFoundation to get the files specific for cpu/os/runtime.
	* core.make: Allow the user to specify a set of variables different
	than the library combo. This is needed when compiling basic libraries
	that don't use the whole library combo (like libFoundation). Also
	define OBJC_RUNTIME that holds the name of the runtime, useful in
	make, and RUNTIME_DEFINE that defines for the runtime, useful while
	compiling. The last one should be added to the additional
	C/ObjC flags.

	file name. Building a shared library is now the default for systems
	that support shared libraries.
	* library.make: Removed the two variables for specifying the shared
	library and the static one. Added two new target variables which
	define commands to be run after the installation of either the static
	or of the shared library.
	* target.make: Define the two new variables above for the different
	supported systems.

	* common.make: Added a partial support for the NeXT compiler. We also
	need a way to determine what compiler is used, which is simple because
	our tools only partially work with the NeXT runtime/compiler.
	* core.make: Support for the NeXT Foundation and AppKit added.
	* rules.make: Use flags to specify the include paths while compiling
	to support NeXT frameworks. Cleanup in the shared libraries support.
