The GNUstep Makefile Package version 2.0.7 is now available.

1.1 What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=========================================

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

1.2 Changes in version `2.0.7'
==============================

   * New configuration file to set default installation

   * gnustep-make now uses the -no-print-directory flag when invoking
     make

   * Files make have same name but different extensions (.c and .m)

   * Change in path checking algorithm in GNUstep.sh and GNUstep.csh

   * Test applications linked against gnustep-gui by default

1.3 Obtaining gnustep-make
