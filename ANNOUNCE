Announcement
************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 1.2.1 is now available.

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

   The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to
write makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to
write a project without having to deal with the complex issues
associated with configuration, building, installation, and packaging.
It also allows the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

Changes in version `1.2.1'
==========================

   * the source distribution code has been rewritten to be more general
     and extended.  Packages built using gnustep-make now automatically
     have handy targets building tarballs from sources or from CVS
     imports.

   * implemented support for auto-dependencies, which means that any
     object file automatically depends on all the header files which
     were used to build it.  Only works with newer compilers.

   * implemented INSTALL_AS_USER and INSTALL_AS_GROUP.

   * implemented a strip=yes option.

   * various bug fixes and minor improvements.
